# hand-gesture-tracking-recognition
implementation of an AI project of hand-tracking and hand-gesture recognition
using opencv and mediapipe.

The implementation was made by implementing an hand_tracking_module.py in which we have simply access to all the fundamentals to detect the hand.
Then we used it (importing it to other files) to make what we wanted (like hand-gesture recognition and volume-gestore recognition).
